HTML-Only Share Buttons
=======================

Here are some social buttons that don't require any Javascript. Just HTML, CSS, and some Font Awesome icons.

Created by Gregory, see how to use them: [Blog post and tutorial](http://schier.co/blog/2014/10/22/pure-html-share-buttons.html)

This branch is heavily modified by myself and in use on [my website](http://www.trueneutral.eu).
